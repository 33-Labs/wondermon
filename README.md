### Test Wondermon Account

You are free to register and use Wondermon, but currently, you will need to transfer a Flovatar to the Wondermon address first. If you prefer not to do so, I have a test account here with a pre-existing Flovatar and some Flobits available for use.

We bring you **Interactive Smart NFT!**

## Digital Companions

Have you ever imagined your NFT turning into a magical portrait like in Harry Potter?

Wondermon is here to unveil the future for you! We have infused NFTs with AI technology, giving them a soul. From now on, NFTs are no longer just still images; they become more vibrant and intriguing. They can be your friends and assistants, engaging in real conversations with you. You can have them praise you, write poetry for you, and even change their outfits at your command! And owners can also freely bestow different personalities upon each NFT (stored on the Flow blockchain), making each NFT even more unique!

## and ... Smart Wallet!

But it doesn't stop there. Apart from conversations, can your NFT also help you execute actions on the blockchain and manage your wallet assets? Thanks to natural language processing technology, we can better enable Smart NFTs to understand your intentions and issue appropriate instructions to send on-chain transactions. This means that Smart NFTs will become your wallet's caretaker, giving you a Smart Wallet!

## Walletless onboarding!

Imagine this: no need to understand concepts like private keys or mnemonic phrases. With Flow's Walletless Onboarding technology, users will be able to directly acquire their Smart NFTs using email and credit card payments, opening up their Web3 smart lives!

NOTEï¼š
We used **Flovatar** as a showcase example for Wondermon. Flovatar's SVG resources are stored on-chain, and the components of Flovatar can be freely replaced and combined (which can only be achieved on Flow). It is an exceptional NFT project!
